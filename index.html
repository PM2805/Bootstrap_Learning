                            <h1>The beginning of a river</h1>
                            <p>
                                The start of a river is called the source or
                                head water. The part of the river that is near
                                the source is called a 'young' river. <p> [1] A
                                    young
                                    river is often in a V-shaped river bed, and
                                    flows quickly downhill over stones, and
                                    around
                                    big rocks. Young rivers often have lots of
                                    small
                                    waterfalls and rapids. As the rivers travel
                                    downhill they begin to erode the ground
                                    taking
                                    small bits of soft rock and soil.
                                </p>

                                The source of a river may be a spring, often on
                                a hill, mountain, glacier, or another high
                                place. A spring is water that flows out from
                                under the ground.
                                The source of a river may be a lake where lots
                                of water from small streams gathers when it
                                rains or snows.
                                A river may begin in mountains where there is
                                snow. The melting snow runs together to form a
                                small stream that runs down the mountain. As
                                more little streams run in, the main stream gets
                                bigger, until it forms a river.
                                Some rivers flow from hills where there is no
                                snow, but lots of rain.
                                Some rivers only flow after there has been rain
                                near the head water.
                            </p>

                            The middle part of a river
                            The middle part of a river is called a mature river.
                            A mature river makes a riverbed that is U-shaped. It
                            might be very deep and run fast. It sweeps over
                            small rocks and boulders, and makes big turns around
                            hills and mountains. It is much wider than a young
                            river, but not as wide as an old river. To cross
                            over a mature river, people use bridges. Many cities
                            and towns are built on the banks of mature rivers.
                            Many farms that keep animals such as dairy cows,
                            horses and sheep are along mature rivers because the
                            animals can drink from the river every day.
